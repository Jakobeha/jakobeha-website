# Context Note

This portfolio's audience consists of admissions people and professors of graduate schools with good programming language research positions. Its purpose is to get those schools to hire me. Although not it's primary target, the portfolio could also help me get into graduate conferences, persuade future employers to hire me, and showcase my work in case anyone's interested. It contains links to my projects (which would showcase my skills and experience), some brief information about me (so graduate schools can determine how well I fit into their culture), my resume (for details not listed on the portfolio), and contact information (in case employers do decide to accept me or want more information). The portfolio is supposed to be realistic, and I plan to convert it into my personal website. However, I adapt it slightly for this class, mainly adding more writing.
