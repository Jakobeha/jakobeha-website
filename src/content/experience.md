I initially started programming as a hobby, working on various side projects. In high school I took AP Computer Science A + AP Computer Science Principles.

At Northeastern, I've taken classes including:

- **CS2500 Fundamentals of Computer Science 1**: Writing simple functional programs in Racket
- **CS4992 "Hack Your Own Language"**: Build a DSL in Racket (my group built a JavaDoc-like extension, which parses documentation into Scribble and checks examples)
- **CS2800 Logic and Computation**: Basic theorem proving with ACL2s
- **CS4800 Algorithms and Data**: Basic algorithms
- **CS3650 Systems**: Low-level systems programming (e.g. assembly) and optimization
- **CS4550 Web Development**: Client (jQuery, React, Angular, Elm), server (Java + Spring Boot, node.js express, Elixir + Phoenix), Database (MySQL + JPA, PostgreSQL + Ecto, MongoDB)
- **CS4992 Directed Study**: Read various papers (abstract interpretation, control flow analysis in Scheme, STM) and wrote summaries / implemented the algorithms
- **ENGW3301 Advanced Writing**: Technical writing to different audiences (e.g. research paper, portfolio)
- Currently taking **CS4910 Verified Compilers**, **CS4500 Software Development**, **CS4200 Networks and Distributed Systems**, and **CS4410 Compilers**

I have also attended numerous hackathons and clubs, and presented a poster at RISE (a small University expo) on a side project, **TreeScript**.

Furthermore, I'm currently doing undergraduate research at [Northeastern's Programming Research Laboratory (PRL)](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/), working on an R compiler called [RIR](https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir). I've learned a lot from this project, including Static Analysis, SSA form, benchmarking / micro-optimization techniques, version control (git + GitHub), and research culture in general.
