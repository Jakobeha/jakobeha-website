Before Northeastern, I worked on many side projects. At Northeastern, I took classes on digital proofs and programming languages, and I'm planning to take a class on formally-verified compilers. I'm currently doing undergraduate research at [Northeastern's Programming Research Laboratory (PRL)](http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/), working on an R compiler called [RIR](https://github.com/reactorlabs/rir).
