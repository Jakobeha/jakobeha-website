I'm a Northeastern University sophomore studying Computer Science. I'm particularly interested in design patterns, programming languages, metaprogramming, and static analysis - informally, "how do we make programming easier?" I plan to go to a graduate school, research these interests,
and contribute whatever information I can to academia.
