This is an essay directed towards people outside of computer science. The first part explains what “clean code” is, why it‘s important, and ultimately that “how to write clean code” is still an open question that many are trying to solve. The second part provides evidence for the latter, by analyzing a scholarly paper (["Coding Guidelines: Finding the Art in the Science"](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/12/142527-coding-guidelines-finding-the-art-in-the-science/fulltext)): in summary, the paper describes programming as an “art”, and proposes rough guidelines for professional programmers and managers on how to write clean code.

This was the first major assignment of a class at Northeastern, **ENGW3302 First Year Writing**. I had to analyze the different components of an existing scholarly paper, so that I would learn to implement those components in future assignments.
