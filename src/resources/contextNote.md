# Context Note

- **Genre:** Interactive public website
- **Distribution:** Other websites, Google search
- **Audience:** Novie developers who are interested in choosing a new language to use or learn about
- **Purpose:** Allow developers to compare programming languages - there are many resources to learn about languages, but they don't show multiple languages side by side

## Clarification

### Genre

This is an interactive public website. It consists of an introduction, which summarizes its purpose, followed by an explanation of how to use it. It isn't meant to be read in any particular order, like an essay. Instead, you read the introduction, then select the languages they're interested in, like a dictionary or reference.

### Distribution

This website would be linked by other popular websites, and ideally, would show up in Google if "compare programming languages" or "which language should I use?" was searched

### Audience

The website's target audience is novice developers who are interested in choosing a new language to use or learn about. They know very basic computer science skills, and vaguely understand terms like "object-oriented" programming, but not much more - they might have took an introductory computer science class, or learned a single language like Java. Most (but not all) are primarily educated are young - almost out of high school, in college, or recently graduated.

These developers particularly need to learn more about languages, so they can choose one which will make their goal easiest. For example, if they want to write a fast program, they would select an efficient language. These developers are also interested in programming languages in general, and as a secondary goal, want to learn more about them.

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to let developers compare programming languages, so they can select which one to use (e.g. to learn or create a new project with). In order to accomplish this, the document informs developers of the different progrmming languages and paradigms, and provides some background on both. However, there are many websites to learn about particular languages and concepts (and this document links to them in case the audience wants to learn more about them). The document is unique because it makes it easier to compare the languages. It provides information which would be particularly useful for comparison (such as benefits and drawbacks). It presents this concisely, first giving an opinion (e.g. "this language is fast"), then afterward providing elaboration and references to clarify and justify. Moreover, the document allows you to select multiple languages and read about their characteristics side by side. If the user wants to learn more about a particular language (e.g. if they've almost decided they want to select it), the document provides links to websites with further information, including tutorials.
